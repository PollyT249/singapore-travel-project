            <h2>Why Singapore?</h2>
            <h3>Singapore, the "Lion City"</h3>
            <p>
              The semi-historical Malay Annals state that Singapura was
              christened by Sang Nila Utama, a 13th-century Sumatran Raja from
              Palembang. Sang Nila Utama encountered a strange beast on the
              island that he took to be a lion. Seeing this as an omen, he
              established the town of Singapura where he encountered the beast.
            </p>
            <p>
              The English name of "Singapore" is an anglicisation of the native
              Malay name for the country, Singapura, which was in turn derived
              from the Sanskrit word for 'lion city'. Singapore is also referred
              to by the nickname the "Garden City", in reference to its parks
              and tree-lined streets.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite its small size, Singapore has a diversity of languages,
              religions, and cultures. Singapore has a diverse music culture
              that ranges from pop and rock, to folk and classical. Western
              classical music plays a significant role in the cultural life in
              Singapore. The nation's lively urban musical scene has made it a
              centre for international performances and festivals in the region.

                  Located inside Gardens By The Bay in Singapore, these
                  majestic, human-made structures, towering at 50m, emulate the

                  There is an elevated walkway, the OCBC Skyway, between two
                  larger Supertrees for visitors to enjoy a panoramic view of
                  the Gardens. Every night, at 7:45pm and 8:45pm, the Supertree
                  Grove comes alive with a coordinated light and music show
                  known as the Garden Rhapsody.

                <h4>Merlion</h4>
                <p>
                  The Merlion is the official mascot of Singapore. It is
                  depicted as a mythical creature with the head of a lion and
                  the body of a fish.

                <h5>What is interesting about it</h5>
                <p>
                  The Merlion was first used in Singapore as the logo for the
                  tourism board. Its name combines "mer", meaning the sea, and
                  "lion". Being of prominent symbolic nature to Singapore and
                  Singaporeans in general, it is widely used to represent both
                  the city state and its people in sports teams, tourism and as
                  a national personification.
